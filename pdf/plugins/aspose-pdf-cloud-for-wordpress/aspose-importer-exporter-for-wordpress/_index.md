## **Introduction**
### **What is WordPress?**
WordPress is a free open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL, which runs on a web hosting service. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. WordPress is used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013. WordPress is the most popular blogging system in use on the Web, at more than 60 million websites. It’s probably the easiest and most powerful blogging and website content management system (or CMS) in existence today.
### **Aspose Importer Exporter**
Aspose Importer / Exporter Plugin allows developers to get/read contents of different documents like PDF, DOC, and DOCX without requiring any other software such as Adobe Acrobat, a PDF reader or Microsoft Word. This plugin also exports posts to PDF, DOC, and DOCX. This plugin demonstrates the powerful import & export feature provided by [Aspose.Pdf](http://www.aspose.com/pdf-component-suite.aspx) & Aspose.Words. It adds a simple**Aspose File Importer** button on posts & pages. When users click the button, they get two options: importing from a local file or from  Aspose Cloud Storage.  The user selects a file (PDF, DOC, or DOCX), clicks **Insert File to Editor** and the text is inserted into the editor from the selected file. This plugin uses WordPress Media Up-loader to upload local files. You can also select files from WordPress Media Gallery.

For the export feature, the plugin works as a bulk action of post or pages or any custom post type. In bulk action, two new options -- **Aspose PDF Exporter** & **Aspose DOC Exporter** are added. When an option is selected, it generates a DOC or PDF pdf file containing all selected posts or page content.
