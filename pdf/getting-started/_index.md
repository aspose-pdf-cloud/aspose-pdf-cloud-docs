# What is a PDF File?

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. The PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.

In most of the cases, existing documents are converted to PDF rather than creating a new PDF from scratch. But that doesnâ€™t mean there are no software for creation or manipulation of PDF files. Aspose.PDF Cloud will help you figure out how to work effectively with PDF documents.
